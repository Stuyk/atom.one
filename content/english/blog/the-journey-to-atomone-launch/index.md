## Summary

AtomOne emerged in response to concerns raised by the community over Proposal 82 and furthered by Proposal 848 on the Cosmos Hub, which highlighted issues surrounding centralization, security and governance inefficiencies within the network. In response, AtomOne was conceived as a minimal fork of Gaia (Cosmos Hub) to address the challenges currently faced by the Cosmos Hub surrounding security, funds management, transparency, tokenomics and validator rewards, while also establishing a more inclusive and adaptable blockchain governance model.
