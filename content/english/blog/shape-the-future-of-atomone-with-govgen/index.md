## Summary

Exciting news! The GovGen governance-only chain intended to help shape the potential outcome of AtomOne has launched. GovGen is a governance-only chain, distinct from the AtomOne hub chain, that aims to help define and finalize the constitution of AtomOne before AtomOne itself launches. The intended purpose of GovGen is only for sentiment assessment of competing proposals relating to the genesis constitution of AtomOne.

GOVGEN tokens were distributed according to the snapshot taken at block #18010657 (November 25, 2023, at 21:00 UTC) on Cosmos Hub to “NO” and “NO_WITH_VETO'' voters on Prop 848 (or those who inherited a dissenting vote via delegation), subject to certain requirements, limitations, and exclusions to qualified GovGen launch validators. Cosmos Hub accounts that voted “YES,” “ABSTAIN,” did not vote, did not inherit a dissenting vote via delegation, or did not meet the specific requirements to become a GovGen genesis launch validator did not receive GOVGEN tokens in this distribution.

The GovGen chain software is a fork of the current running version of the Cosmos Hub with minimal modifications (for example, SendTX is disabled). The GOVGEN token is not transferable and is intended never to be transferable, never to pay dividends or distributions of any sort, and to be used for governance only.
